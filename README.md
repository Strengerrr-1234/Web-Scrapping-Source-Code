# Web-Scrapping-Tool

A basic web scraper written in Python. This example fetches a webpage, parses its content, and extracts specific elements such as headings, links, or paragraphs. 

## How It Works

1.`requests.get(url)`: Fetches the webpage content.
    
  * The `response.status_code` ensures the request was successful (200).
    
2.`BeautifulSoup`: Parses the HTML content.
      
  * `"html.parser"` specifies the parser to use.
    
3.`Extracting Elements`:
  * Headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`):
         Extracted using `find_all` with a list of tag names.
  * Hyperlinks (`<a>` tags):
        Extracted along with their `href` attributes.
  * Paragraphs (`<p>` tags):
        Extracted and printed.

## Output Example

When run against `https://example.com`, it might output:
```
Headings:
Example Domain

Links:
More information: https://www.iana.org/domains/example

Paragraphs:
This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.
```

## Requirements

Install the required libraries:
```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Customization
  * Replace `url` with the target webpage.
  * Modify the `find_all` calls to scrape specific tags or classes (e.g., `soup.find_all('div', class_='example-class')`).

## Advanced Features
 ### 1. Dynamic Content: 
   For JavaScript-rendered pages, use `selenium` with a headless browser like Chrome or Firefox.
 ### 2. Save to File: 
   Write the extracted data to a CSV or JSON file for further analysis.
 ### 3. Pagination: 
   Scrape multiple pages by iterating over page URLs.
